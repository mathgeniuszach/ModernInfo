# Bow Charge

This is a 1.8.9 mod for showing how charged your bow really is.

For some reason, in vanilla, the bow's last sprite displays when the bow is 90% charged. This mod shows a charge bar that turns red (or another configurable color) when fully charged.

This mod will not be ported to any other versions. Use a resource pack for those.
